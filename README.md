# RemoteClaw

A terminal UI for chatting with LLMs through a [Moltbot](https://github.com/jokim1/moltbot) gateway.

Remote into your Moltbot from your terminal on your Mac/PC/whatever. Switch between models from multiple providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Google, Moonshot) with a single keypress, track costs and rate limits in real time, use voice input/output, and manage conversation sessions — all from your terminal.

Built with React + [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) by [Claude Opus 4.5](https://anthropic.com) and [Joseph Kim](https://github.com/jokim1).

## How it works

There are two pieces:

1. **RemoteClaw** (this repo) — the terminal client that runs on your local machine
2. **[RemoteClawGateway](https://github.com/jokim1/RemoteClawGateway)** — a Moltbot plugin that runs on your server

Your server (running Moltbot) holds all the API keys and talks to the LLM providers. RemoteClaw connects to it over HTTP and gives you a nice terminal UI.

```

```

## Setup

### Step 1: Set up the gateway (on your server)

Install the [RemoteClawGateway](https://github.com/jokim1/RemoteClawGateway) plugin on your Moltbot instance. See that repo's README for instructions.

Once the plugin is running, you'll have a gateway URL (e.g. `http://100.x.x.x:18789`) and optionally an auth token.

### Step 2: Set up Tailscale (on both machines)

RemoteClaw uses [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) to securely connect your local machine to your server. Tailscale creates a private mesh VPN — each device gets a stable `100.x.x.x` IP address that works from anywhere, without port forwarding or firewall configuration.

**On your server (where Moltbot runs):**

1. Install Tailscale: https://tailscale.com/download
2. Start Tailscale and log in:
   ```bash
   sudo tailscale up
   ```
3. Note your server's Tailscale IP:
   ```bash
   tailscale ip -4
   # Example output: 100.85.123.45
   ```

**On your local machine (where you'll run RemoteClaw):**

1. Install Tailscale:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install tailscale
   # Then start the service:
   brew services start tailscale

   # Or download from: https://tailscale.com/download
   ```
2. Log in with the same Tailscale account:
   ```bash
   tailscale up
   ```
3. Verify you can reach your server:
   ```bash
   # Replace with your server's Tailscale IP from above
   ping 100.85.123.45
   ```

Once both machines are on the same Tailscale network, your server's gateway (e.g. `http://100.85.123.45:18789`) is reachable from your machine as if it were on the local network.

RemoteClaw monitors Tailscale status and shows it in the status bar (`TS:●`). If Tailscale isn't connected, RemoteClaw tells you exactly what's wrong — not installed, daemon not running, or not logged in.

> **Note:** If your server is on the same local network (or is localhost), you can skip Tailscale and use the local IP directly. Tailscale is for remote access from anywhere.

### Step 3: Install RemoteClaw (on your machine)

```bash
npm install -g @jokim1/remoteclaw
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jokim1/RemoteClaw.git
cd RemoteClaw
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

Requires **Node.js 20+**.

### Step 4: Point RemoteClaw at your gateway

```bash
# Set your gateway URL (use your server's Tailscale IP)
remoteclaw config --gateway http://100.85.123.45:18789

# Set auth token (if your gateway requires one)
remoteclaw config --token your-token-here

# Optionally pick a default model
remoteclaw config --model deepseek/deepseek-chat
```

### Step 5: Run it

```bash
remoteclaw
```

RemoteClaw connects to your gateway over Tailscale, discovers available models, and drops you into the chat.

## Features

- **Multi-model chat** — talk to Claude, GPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Kimi, and more through one interface
- **Model health probing** — when you switch models, RemoteClaw verifies the model is responding before you use it
- **Model mismatch detection** — if the gateway silently routes to a different model, RemoteClaw warns you
- **Cost tracking** — shows today's spend, weekly total, monthly estimate, and per-session cost for API-billed providers
- **Rate limit monitoring** — for subscription plans (e.g. Anthropic Max), shows usage progress bar and reset countdown
- **Voice input/output** — push-to-talk speech input with live volume meter and auto-play speech output (requires [SoX](https://sox.sourceforge.net/) and gateway voice support)
- **Session persistence** — conversations saved to disk, browsable and searchable across sessions
- **Tailscale-aware** — monitors Tailscale VPN status for connectivity diagnostics

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Q` | Open model picker |
| `Ctrl+N` | Open new terminal window |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear current chat |
| `Ctrl+T` | Open transcript browser |
| `Ctrl+V` | Push-to-talk voice input (if available) |
| `Escape` | Cancel voice recording / stop playback |
| `Ctrl+C` | Exit |

## Switching models

Three ways:

1. **Model picker** — `Ctrl+Q` to browse models grouped by provider
2. **Slash command** — type `/model sonnet` or `/model deepseek/deepseek-chat`
3. **Alias** — short names like `deep`, `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `gpt`, `gemini`, `kimi`

When you switch, RemoteClaw probes the model to verify it's responding, then updates the status bar.

## Supported models

| Provider | Model | Alias | Pricing (in/out per 1M tokens) |
|----------|-------|-------|-------------------------------|
| DeepSeek | DeepSeek Chat | `deep` | $0.14 / $0.28 |
| DeepSeek | DeepSeek Reasoner | `deepr1` | $0.55 / $2.19 |
| Anthropic | Claude Opus 4.5 | `opus` | $15 / $75 |
| Anthropic | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | `sonnet` | $3 / $15 |
| Anthropic | Claude Haiku 3.5 | `haiku` | $0.80 / $4 |
| OpenAI | GPT-5.2 | `gpt` | $2.50 / $10 |
| OpenAI | GPT-5 Mini | `gptmini` | $0.15 / $0.60 |
| OpenAI | GPT-4o | `gpt4o` | $2.50 / $10 |
| OpenAI | GPT-4o Mini | `gpt4omini` | $0.15 / $0.60 |
| Google | Gemini 2.5 Flash | `gemini` | $0.15 / $0.60 |
| Google | Gemini 3 Pro | `geminipro` | $1.25 / $5 |
| Google | Gemini 3 Flash | `gemini3flash` | $0.15 / $0.60 |
| Moonshot | Kimi K2 | `kimi` | $0.60 / $2.40 |

Models not in this list are auto-discovered from the gateway at runtime.

## Status bar

```
GW:● TS:● M:Deep  V:●  $0.14/$0.28  Today $1.23  Wk $8.61  ~Mo $37  Sess $0.08  Mic:●  Session 1
```

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `GW:●` | Gateway: green = online, yellow = connecting, red = offline |
| `TS:●` | Tailscale: green = connected, yellow = checking, red = not running |
| `M:Deep` | Model: green = verified, yellow = checking, red = error |
| `V:●` | Voice: green = ready, red = recording, yellow = processing, magenta = playing |
| `Mic:●` | Mic readiness: green = ready, yellow = checking, red = unavailable |

### Billing display

**API providers** show per-token pricing, daily spend, weekly total, monthly estimate, and session cost:
```
$0.14/$0.28  Today $1.23  Wk $8.61  ~Mo $37  Sess $0.08
```

**Subscription providers** (e.g. Anthropic Max) show a rate-limit progress bar:
```
Max Pro  ████░░░░░░ 12% wk  Resets 3d 20h
```

## Voice

RemoteClaw supports push-to-talk voice input and auto-play voice output. This requires:

1. **[SoX](https://sox.sourceforge.net/) installed locally** — for recording and playback
2. **Gateway voice support** — the [RemoteClawGateway](https://github.com/jokim1/RemoteClawGateway) plugin with `OPENAI_API_KEY` set on the server

### Install SoX

```bash
# macOS
brew install sox

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install sox

# Arch
sudo pacman -S sox
```

### How it works

1. Press **Ctrl+V** to start recording — the input area shows a live volume meter
2. Press **Ctrl+V** again to stop and send for transcription
3. Transcribed text is sent immediately (auto-send is on by default)
4. When the assistant responds, the response is automatically spoken aloud

Press **Escape** at any time to cancel recording or stop playback.

If voice isn't available, **Ctrl+V** shows a diagnostic explaining why (SoX not installed, gateway unreachable, no STT provider configured, etc.).

### Voice config

```bash
# Disable auto-send to edit transcribed text before sending (auto-send is on by default)
remoteclaw config --no-voice-auto-send

# Disable auto-play of responses (on by default)
remoteclaw config --no-voice-auto-play

# Change TTS voice (alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer)
remoteclaw config --voice-tts-voice nova
```

If SoX isn't installed or the gateway doesn't support voice, pressing Ctrl+V shows a diagnostic message explaining what's needed.

## Tailscale

RemoteClaw is designed for remote access — your server holds the API keys and runs the Moltbot gateway, and you connect to it from your laptop, phone, or any other machine. [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) makes this easy.

### What Tailscale does

Tailscale creates a private mesh VPN between your devices. Each device gets a stable IP address (like `100.85.123.45`) that works from anywhere — at home, at a coffee shop, on a plane. No port forwarding, no DNS, no firewall rules.

Your server's gateway runs on a local port (e.g. `18789`). With Tailscale, you access it at `http://100.85.123.45:18789` from any of your devices.

### How RemoteClaw uses Tailscale

RemoteClaw checks Tailscale status on startup and continuously while running:

- **On startup** — if the gateway is unreachable, RemoteClaw checks Tailscale and tells you exactly what's wrong:
  - `Tailscale is not installed` — with install instructions
  - `Tailscale daemon is not running` — with the command to start it
  - `Tailscale is not authenticated` — tells you to run `tailscale up`
  - `Tailscale is connected but gateway unreachable` — suggests checking the server

- **While running** — the status bar shows `TS:●` (green = connected, red = disconnected). If Tailscale drops, you'll see it immediately.

### Tailscale status indicators

| Status | Indicator | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Connected | `TS:●` (green) | VPN tunnel active, gateway reachable |
| Checking | `TS:●` (yellow) | Status being verified |
| Not connected | `TS:○` (red) | Not installed, not running, or not logged in |

### Without Tailscale

If your server is on the same local network or is localhost, you don't need Tailscale. Just point RemoteClaw at the local address:

```bash
remoteclaw config --gateway http://192.168.1.50:18789
# or
remoteclaw config --gateway http://localhost:18789
```

RemoteClaw will still show Tailscale status, but it won't affect connectivity.

## Billing configuration

RemoteClaw auto-detects billing mode from the gateway plugin. You can also configure it manually:

```bash
# Set Anthropic to subscription billing
remoteclaw config --billing anthropic:subscription:Max Pro:200

# Reset to API billing
remoteclaw config --billing anthropic:api

# View current config
remoteclaw config --show
```

Format: `provider:mode[:plan[:price]]`

## Anthropic rate limits

Rate limit data is normally fetched from the gateway. If the gateway can't provide it (e.g. OAuth scope error), RemoteClaw can fetch rate limits directly from Anthropic's API as a fallback:

```bash
# Set via config
remoteclaw config --anthropic-key sk-ant-...

# Or via environment variable
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

When configured, RemoteClaw makes a minimal probe request (`max_tokens: 1`) to Anthropic's `/v1/messages` endpoint and reads the `anthropic-ratelimit-*` response headers. This only triggers for Anthropic models and only when the gateway doesn't return rate limit data.

## Configuration

All config is stored in `~/.remoteclaw/config.json`:

```json
{
  "gatewayUrl": "http://100.x.x.x:18789",
  "agentId": "remoteclaw",
  "gatewayToken": "your-token",
  "defaultModel": "deepseek/deepseek-chat",
  "billing": {
    "anthropic": {
      "mode": "subscription",
      "plan": "Max Pro",
      "monthlyPrice": 200
    }
  },
  "voice": {
    "autoSend": true,
    "autoPlay": true,
    "ttsVoice": "nova",
    "ttsSpeed": 1.0
  },
  "anthropicApiKey": "sk-ant-..."
}
```

Resolution priority: CLI flags > environment variables > config file > defaults.

Environment variables: `REMOTECLAW_GATEWAY_URL`, `REMOTECLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

Session transcripts are stored in `~/.remoteclaw/sessions/`.
