# Test Skill
When the user asks to test a feature:
1. Identify the relevant source files
2. Write automated unit/integration tests using the project's test framework
3. Run the tests via the CLI test runner (NOT by launching the app interactively)
4. If the feature involves TUI/interactive UI, test the underlying logic only
5. Report results and coverage
